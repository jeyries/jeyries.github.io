## From 2016 to 2019 - Senior Software Engineer at Dashlane

I primarily contributed to Dashlane as a developer for the iOS and macOS applications. 
My primary responsibilities included:
* Transitioning the code base from Objective-C and C++ to Swift.
* Refactoring and modernizing legacy code to a new Swift codebase.
* Implementing modularization using frameworks for better code organization and reusability.
