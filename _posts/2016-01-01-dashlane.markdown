## From 2016 to 2019 - Senior Software Engineer - Dashlane

I primarily contributed to Dashlane as a developer for the iOS and macOS applications. 
My key responsibilities involved:
* Transitioning the code base from Objective-C / C++ to Swift.
* Refactoring and modernizing legacy code to a new Swift code base.
* Implementing modularization through the use of frameworks for better code organization and reusability.
