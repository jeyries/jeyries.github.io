## 2019 - iOS Tech Lead at Unibet

Together with two other iOS developers, we completely rebuilt the Unibet sports betting application and switched to pure native Swift code.
Technical aspects involved:
* Implementing MVVM architecture using RxSwift and UIKit
* Using the coordinator pattern for navigation
* Applying dependency injection for service integration
