## From 2022 to 2023 - iOS Full Stack Developer at TF1

I enhanced and maintained the Player SDK, a critical component that orchestrates video streaming, manages access permissions, measures viewer engagement, tracks user analytics, and integrates advertising.
This SDK is integrated into three applications owned by the TF1 Group: TF1+, TFOU and TF1 Info.

Key technical advances include:
* Moving from storyboard-based layouts to fully code-based UIs with UIKit
* Added support for Apple TV
* Implementation of JWT token-based authentication
* Using GraphQL to retrieve video metadata
* Switching dependency management from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager
* Replacing a custom RxSwift implementation with Apple's Combine framework
* Developing a user metrics backend in Go, including routing data to Kafka and using Grafana for real-time analytics
