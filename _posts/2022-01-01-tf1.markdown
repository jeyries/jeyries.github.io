## From 2022 to 2023 - iOS Full Stack Developer at TF1

I enhanced and maintained the Player SDK, a critical component that orchestrates video streaming, manages access permissions, measures viewer engagement, tracks user analytics, and integrates advertising.
This SDK is integrated into three TF1 Group applications.

Key technical advances include:
* Moving from storyboard-based layouts to fully code-based UIs with UIKit
* Added support for Apple TV
* Implementation of JWT token-based authentication
* Use of GraphQL to retrieve video metadata
* Switch dependency management from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager
* Replace a custom RxSwift implementation with Apple's Combine framework
* Maintaining a user metrics backend in Go, including routing data to Kafka and using Grafana for real-time analysis
