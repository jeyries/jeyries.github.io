## From 2022 to 2023 - iOS Full Stack Developer - e-TF1

I have enhanced and sustained the Player SDK, a crucial component that orchestrates video streaming, manages access permissions, gauges audience engagement, tracks user analytics, and integrates advertisements. This SDK is incorporated into three applications owned by the TF1 group: MyTF1, TFOU, and TF1 Info.

Key technical advancements include:
* Transitioning from storyboard-based layouts to entirely code-based UIs with UIKit
* Adding support for Apple TV
* Implementing JWT token-based authentication
* Utilizing GraphQL to fetch video metadata
* Switching dependency management from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager
* Replacing a custom RxSwift implementation with Apple's Combine framework
* Developing a backend in Go for user metrics, which includes routing data to Kafka and using Grafana for real-time analytics
